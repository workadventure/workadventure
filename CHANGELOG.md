- New scripting API features :
  - Use `WA.onInit(): Promise<void>` to wait for scripting API initialization
  - Use `WA.room.showLayer(): void` to show a layer
  - Use `WA.room.hideLayer(): void` to hide a layer
  - Use `WA.room.setProperty() : void` to add, delete or change existing property of a layer
  - Use `WA.player.onPlayerMove(): void` to track the movement of the current player
  - Use `WA.player.id: string|undefined` to get the ID of the current player
  - Use `WA.player.name: string` to get the name of the current player
  - Use `WA.player.tags: string[]` to get the tags of the current player
  - Use `WA.room.id: string` to get the ID of the room
  - Use `WA.room.mapURL: string` to get the URL of the map
  - Use `WA.room.mapURL: string` to get the URL of the map

  - Use `WA.state.onVariableChange(key: string): Observable<unknown>` to track a variable
  - Use `WA.state.[any variable]: unknown` to access directly any variable (this is a shortcut to using `WA.state.loadVariable` and `WA.state.saveVariable`)
- Users blocking now relies on UUID rather than ID. A blocked user that leaves a room and comes back will stay blocked.
- The text chat was redesigned to be prettier and to use more features :
  - The chat is now persistent between discussions and always accessible
  - The chat now tracks incoming and outcoming users in your conversation
  - The chat allows your to see the visit card of users
  - You can close the chat window with the escape key
- Added a 'Enable notifications' button in the menu.
- The exchange format between Pusher and Admin servers has changed. If you have your own implementation of an admin server, these endpoints signatures have changed:
  - `/api/map`: now accepts a complete room URL instead of organization/world/room slugs
  - `/api/ban`: new endpoint to report users
  - as a side effect, the "routing" is now completely stored on the admin side, so by implementing your own admin server, you can develop completely custom routing

## Version 1.4.3 - 1.4.4 - 1.4.5

## Bugfixes

## Version 1.4.2

## Updates

    Please keep in mind that the scripting API is still experimental. Some breaking changes can occur in it until we mark it as stable.

### Updates

- Added the emote feature to WorkAdventure. (@Kharhamel, @Tabascoeye)
  - The emote menu can be opened by clicking on your character.
  -  Clicking on one of its element will close the menu and play an emote above your character.
  -  This emote can be seen by other players.
- Player names were improved. (@Kharhamel)
  - We now create a GameObject.Text instead of GameObject.BitmapText
  - now use the 'Press Start 2P' font family and added an outline
  - As a result, we can now allow non-standard letters like french accents or chinese characters!

- Added the contact card feature. (@Kharhamel)
  - Click on another player to see its contact info.
  - Premium-only feature unfortunately. I need to find a way to make it available for all.
  - If no contact data is found (either because the user is anonymous or because no admin backend), display an error card.

- Mobile support has been improved
  - WorkAdventure automatically sets the zoom level based on the viewport size to ensure a sensible size of the map is visible, whatever the viewport used
  - Mouse wheel support to zoom in / out
  - Pinch support on mobile to zoom in / out
  - Improved virtual joystick size (adapts to the zoom level)
- Redesigned intermediate scenes
  - Redesigned Select Companion scene
  - Redesigned Enter Your Name scene
    - Added a new `DISPLAY_TERMS_OF_USE` environment variable to trigger the display of terms of use
