# WorkAdventure


WorkAdventure is a platform that allows you to design **fully customizable collaborative virtual worlds** (metaverse). 

With your own avatar, you can **interact spontaneously** with your colleagues, clients, partners (using a **video-chat system**, triggered when you approach someone).
Imagine **all types of immersive experiences** (recruitments, onboarding, trainings, digital workplace, internal/external events) on desktop, mobile or tablet.

_The little plus? The platform is **GDPR** and **open source**!_

## Setting up a production environment

We support 2 ways to set up a production environment:

- using Docker Compose
- or using a Helm chart for Kubernetes

Please check the [Setting up a production environment](docs/others/self-hosting/install.md) guide for more information.

> [!NOTE]
> WorkAdventure also provides a [hosted version](https://workadventu.re/?utm_source=github) of the application. Using the hosted version is
> the easiest way to get started and helps us to keep the project alive.

## Setting up a development environment

> [!NOTE]
> These installation instructions are for local development only. They will not work on
> remote servers as local environments do not have HTTPS certificates.

Install Docker and clone this repository.

> [!WARNING]
> If you are using Windows, make sure the End-Of-Line character is not modified by the cloning process by setting
> the `core.autocrlf` setting to false: `git config --global core.autocrlf false`

Run:

```
cp .env.template .env
docker-compose up
```

The environment will start with the OIDC mock server enabled by default.

You should now be able to browse to http://play.workadventure.localhost/ and see the application.
You can view the Traefik dashboard at http://traefik.workadventure.localhost

(Test user is "User1" and password is "pwd")

If you want to disable the OIDC mock server (for anonymous access), you can run:

```console
$ docker-compose -f docker-compose.yaml -f docker-compose-no-oidc.yaml up
```

Note: on some OSes, you will need to add this line to your `/etc/hosts` file:

**/etc/hosts**
```
127.0.0.1 oidc.workadventure.localhost redis.workadventure.localhost play.workadventure.localhost traefik.workadventure.localhost matrix.workadventure.localhost extra.workadventure.localhost icon.workadventure.localhost map-storage.workadventure.localhost uploader.workadventure.localhost maps.workadventure.localhost api.workadventure.localhost front.workadventure.localhost
```
