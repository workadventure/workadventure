This Helm chart deploys Workadventure on Kubernetes.

## Migration from Bitnami Charts (Important!)

**As of August 27th, 2024, Bitnami charts are no longer freely available.** This chart has been updated to remove dependencies on Bitnami charts and now includes a built-in Redis deployment.

### Redis Migration Guide

If you are upgrading from a previous version that used the Bitnami Redis chart, please follow these steps to migrate your Redis data:

#### 1. Backup your existing Redis data

Before upgrading, backup your Redis data if you have persistence enabled:

```bash
# Get the current Redis pod name
kubectl get pods -l app.kubernetes.io/name=redis

# Create a backup
kubectl exec -it <redis-pod-name> -- redis-cli SAVE
kubectl cp <redis-pod-name>:/data/dump.rdb ./redis-backup.rdb
```

#### 2. Update your values.yaml

The Redis configuration structure has changed. Update your `values.yaml`:

**Old Bitnami Redis configuration:**
```yaml
redis:
  architecture: standalone
  auth:
    enabled: false
  master:
    persistence:
      enabled: true
      storageClass: "fast-ssd"
      size: 8Gi
```

**New Redis configuration:**
```yaml
redis:
  enabled: true
  auth:
    enabled: false
  persistence:
    enabled: true
    storageClass: "fast-ssd"
    size: 8Gi
```

#### 3. Handle Persistent Volumes

If you had persistence enabled with the Bitnami chart, you'll need to migrate the data:

**Option A: Manual Migration (Recommended)**
1. Scale down the old Redis deployment
2. Create a temporary pod to access the old PVC
3. Copy data to the new Redis PVC
4. Update your Helm release

**Option B: PVC Renaming**
If your old PVC was named `data-<release-name>-redis-master-0`, you can rename it to match the new naming:
```bash
# Patch the old PVC to match new naming convention
kubectl patch pvc data-<release-name>-redis-master-0 -p '{"metadata":{"name":"<release-name>-workadventure-redis-data"}}'
```

#### 4. Upgrade the Helm chart

After updating your `values.yaml` and handling the PVC migration:

```bash
helm upgrade <release-name> workadventure/workadventure -f values.yaml
```

#### 5. Restore data (if needed)

If you need to restore from backup:

```bash
# Copy backup to new Redis pod
kubectl cp ./redis-backup.rdb <new-redis-pod-name>:/data/

# Restart Redis to load the backup
kubectl delete pod <new-redis-pod-name>
```

### Redis Configuration Options

The built-in Redis deployment supports the following configuration options:

```yaml
redis:
  enabled: true                    # Enable/disable Redis deployment
  
  image:
    repository: redis              # Redis image repository
    tag: "7.2-alpine"             # Redis version
    pullPolicy: IfNotPresent      # Image pull policy
  
  auth:
    enabled: false                 # Enable Redis authentication
    password: ""                   # Redis password (if auth enabled)
  
  persistence:
    enabled: false                 # Enable persistent storage
    storageClass: ""              # Storage class for PVC
    accessMode: ReadWriteOnce     # Access mode for PVC
    size: 8Gi                     # Size of persistent volume
    
  resources: {}                   # Resource limits and requests
  nodeSelector: {}               # Node selector
  tolerations: []                # Pod tolerations
  affinity: {}                   # Pod affinity rules
  
  service:
    type: ClusterIP              # Service type
    port: 6379                   # Redis port
```

## Installation

    helm repo add workadventure https://charts.workadventu.re/
    helm install workadventure workadventure/workadventure

## Version numbering and upgrading

Versions of the Helm chart are aligned with the versions of the WorkAdventure Docker image. 
When a new version of the WorkAdventure Docker images are released, a new version of the Helm chart is released as well.

> [!WARNING]
> This Helm chart is newer than the [Docker Compose install](../docker/README.md) and might change more frequently in the 
> coming month. Therefore, we do not (yet) guarantee the absence of breaking changes between minor or patch versions.
> When upgrading, please check changes in `values.yaml`. We will try to document breaking changes in the 
> [release notes](https://github.com/workadventure/workadventure/releases).


## Configuration

The chart is designed to work out of the box with the minimum required configuration.

The two compulsory parameters you need to provide are:
- the `domainName` parameter that should point to the domain name that will host WorkAdventure.
- the `mÌ€apstorage.secretEnv.AUTHENTICATION_PASSWORD` parameter that you should set to a password to access the map-storage container.

> [!NOTE]
> Please note that this chart does not provide SSL certificates generation by default.
> It is your responsibility to ensure certificates are correctly handled (either by providing
> one in an appropriate secret, by using CertManager to generate certificates automatically
> or by using Traefik as a reverse proxy properly configured to generate certificates).

For each pod, there is a corresponding `xxx.env` entry in the `values.yaml` file (that will map to a `ConfigMap`),
and a `xxx.secretEnv` entry (that will map to a `Secret`). There are many pre initialized variables in the template files
(all variables relative to the URLs). Additional entries can be easily added in the corresponding 
sections of the values file.

Furthermore, the `commonEnv` and `commonSecretEnv` sections can be used to add environment variables in all pods.

If you don't provide a `secretKey` (used to encode JWT tokens), the image will generate one for you.

Please use the original [docker-compose file](../docker/docker-compose.prod.yaml) for reference. Look at the [original configuration template](../docker/.env.prod.template) for more information about the available variables.

### Minimal sample configuration file

Assuming you are using the nginx ingress controller, and CertManager for the SSL certificates (with a cluster issuer named `letsencrypt-prod`), here is a minimal configuration file:

**values.yaml**
```yaml
domainName: example.com

singleDomain: true

ingress:
  enabled: true
  className: "nginx"
  tls: true
  secretName: "workadventure-cert"
  annotationsRoot:
    cert-manager.io/cluster-issuer: "letsencrypt-prod"
  annotationsPath:
    cert-manager.io/cluster-issuer: "letsencrypt-prod"

# Redis configuration (using built-in Redis deployment)
redis:
  enabled: true
  persistence:
    enabled: true
    storageClass: "fast-ssd"  # Use your preferred storage class
    size: 8Gi

commonSecretEnv:
  # Secret token to connect to the map storage API.
  MAP_STORAGE_API_TOKEN: "123"

mapstorage:
  env:
    # Enable Bearer authentication for the map storage API so that we can connect using "npm run upload" in the map-starter-kit
    ENABLE_BEARER_AUTHENTICATION: "true"
  secretEnv:
    AUTHENTICATION_PASSWORD: "my-password"
```

## Upload your map

Before starting using WorkAdventure, you will need to upload your first map.

#### Uploading from the map starter kit

Design your own map using the [map starter kit](https://github.com/workadventure/map-starter-kit).
When you are happy with the result, [follow the steps in the "upload your map documentation"](https://docs.workadventu.re/map-building/tiled-editor/publish/wa-hosted)

With the sample installation above, the command to upload your map will look like this:

```bash
npm run upload -- -u https://example.com/map-storage/ -k 123
```

#### Checking everything worked

Open your browser and go to `https://<your-domain>/map-storage/` (or `https://map-storage.<your-domain>` if you are 
using `singleDomain: false` in `values.yaml`).

You will be asked to authenticate. Use the credentials you configured in the `.env` file.

> **Note**
> Right now, authentication is limited to a single user credential in the map-storage container,
> hard coded in the `.env` file. This is not ideal, but works for now (the map-storage container
> is quite new). Contributions are welcome if you want to improve this.

You should see a link to the map you just uploaded.

Are you connected? Congratulations! Share the URL with your friends and start using WorkAdventure!
