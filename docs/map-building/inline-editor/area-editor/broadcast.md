# Broadcasting / Presentation Zones

Use the broadcast feature to build speaker zones (aka. podiums) to stream your video / audio / screen to anyone
in the corresponding listen zone.

You typically use this feature to build a stage where a speaker can present to an audience.
The stage is the **speaker zone**. Anyone walking on the stage will be able to stream their video / audio / screen.
The audience is the **listening zone**. Anyone walking in the audience will be able to see and hear the speaker(s) in
the speaker zone.

Please note that [access to the map editor](../index.md) is required to perform the following steps.

9. Select the name of the speaker zone that you already created in the "speaker zone name" selector.
10. (Optional) You can also create a chat channel for this zone. This channel will be used to chat with the people in the listener zone.

:::note
If you enable "associate a dedicated chat channel" in both areas, both chats will be merged and can be used by users in the speaker zone and in the listener zone.
:::

You're done ! Now, anyone in the listener zone will be able to hear/see the speakers that are in the speaker zone.
When a user will enter the speaker zone, he will trigger the megaphone directly and will stream to the listener zones associated with the speaker zone.
