# Broadcasting / Presentation Zones

Use the broadcast feature to build speaker zones (aka. podiums) to stream your video / audio / screen to anyone
in the corresponding listen zone.

You typically use this feature to build a stage where a speaker can present to an audience.
The stage is the **speaker zone**. Anyone walking on the stage will be able to stream their video / audio / screen.
The audience is the **listening zone**. Anyone walking in the audience will be able to see and hear the speaker(s) in
the speaker zone.

Please note that [access to the map editor](../index.md) is required to perform the following steps.
