2. You can drag and drop or select the PDF/image that will be opened when the player enters the area.

## A note about security

The files you upload are stored in a special secured section of our map-storage servers. By default, only the users that have access to your map can download your files.
You can restrict access to your files further by adding a "Restricted area" property in addition to your "file" property. If you do so, users will need to have the tags specified in the "Restricted area" property in order to download your file.
