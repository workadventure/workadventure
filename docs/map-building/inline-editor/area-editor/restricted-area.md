# Restricted area

## Description

An area with rights access is a restricted area. In this kind of area, you can configure who can enter the area, and also decide who can place objects in the area.


## Create a restricted area

While editing an area, select the area rights option.

You can now define editing and access rights by specifying the user tags you want to allow.

## User without area access

A user without access to an area will be stopped near the restricted zone. A message will appear, and the restricted area will be highlighted in red.

## Place objects for allowed users

Allowed users can place objects inside the area. They have access to the entity editor and are guided to place the object in the appropriate zone.

Only users with the edit access tag can place objects inside the area. Users with the read access tag can only access the area and view and interact with its objects.
