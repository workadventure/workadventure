# Focusable property

When you make an area "focusable", the camera automatically zooms on the area when the user enters it.
Apply this to a meeting room, for instance, to show the entire space.

Focusable areas have one property: the "zoom margin".
If your focusable area is small, we recommend setting a zoom margin. The camera will slightly zoom out from the area. This prevents overâ€‘zooming and generally provides a better view.

## Setting focusable area
1. When editing an area, add the focusable property by clicking the "focusable" icon.
