3. Create an area by clicking on the map directly or by selecting a zone.
4. Click on the "start" icon.

:::info Pro tip
If you expect many people to connect to your map at the same time (for instance, if you are organizing a big event), consider making a large start area. This way, users will not all appear at the same position and will not pop randomly in a chat with someone connecting at the same moment.

:::info
If your map already has start positions defined in Tiled, areas defined in the map editor will take precedence.
