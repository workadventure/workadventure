# Open document property

On your map, you can define entities that open a document when a user presses space after coming to the entity.

There are 2 ways to do this:

- From the map editor, you can upload the documents to be displayed.
- or simply drag'n'drop a PDF/image file on the map directly

:::note
The uploaded documents format can be PDF files, or images.
:::

## Drag'n'drop a PDF/image file on the map directly

You can simply drag'n'drop a PDF/image file on the map directly.

When you drop the file, a popup will ask you to choose the entity image.
You can then place the entity on the map.

## Configuring an open document entity

While editing an entity, click the "file" icon.

1. You can define the way the action is triggered.
2. You can drag and drop or select the PDF/image that will be opened when the player enters the entity.
3. Those settings are related to the way the action is triggered. You can choose to open the pdf in a new tab, or in a cowebsite, the size of the cowebsite, if it can be closed, etc ...
