# Drag and drop files

:::warning
This will create an entity to open the document you want to drop. If you want the entity to be the image you dropped, here is where you can do it: [custom entity](./index.md#uploading-an-object)
:::

You can create entities with a simple drag and drop of a file on the map.
It is a shortcut to create an entity with the [open document property](./open-file.md).

:::note
The uploaded documents format can be PDF files, or images.

## Creating an open document entity

First drop a file on the map.

1. You can first choose the entity you will drop on the map. The first input here is to filter the entities.
2. After choosing the entity or keeping the default one you can change the name of the entity.
3. Finally you can save and click to place the entity wherever you want.

If you want to change the settings it will be possible to do it like in the [open document property](./open-file.md#open-document-property).
