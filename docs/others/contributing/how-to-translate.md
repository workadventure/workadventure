# How to translate WorkAdventure

We use the [typesafe-i18n](https://github.com/ivanhofer/typesafe-i18n) package to handle the translation.

## Add a new language

It is very easy to add a new language!

First, in the `front/src/i18n` folder create a new folder with the language code as name (the language code according to [RFC 5646](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5646)).

In the previously created folder, add a file named index.ts with the following content containing your language information (french from France in this example):

```ts
import type { Translation } from "../i18n-types";

const fr_FR: Translation = {
  ...en_US,
  language: "Fran√ßais",
  country: "France",
};

export default fr_FR;
```

## Add a new key

### Add a simple key

The keys are searched by a path through the properties of the sub-objects and it is therefore advisable to write your translation as a JavaScript object.

Please use kamelcase to name your keys!

Example:

```ts
{
  messages: {
    coffeMachine: {
      start: "Coffe machine has been started!";
    }
  }
}
```

In the code you can translate using `$LL`:

```ts
import LL from "../../i18n/i18n-svelte";

console.log($LL.messages.coffeMachine.start());
```

### Add a key with parameters

You can also use parameters to make the translation dynamic.
Use the tag { [parameter name] } to apply your parameters in the translations

Example:

```ts
{
  messages: {
    coffeMachine: {
      playerStart: "{ playerName } started the coffee machine!";
    }
  }
}
```

In the code you can use it like this:

```ts
$LL.messages.coffeMachine.playerStart.start({
  playerName: "John",
});
```

## Check missing translations (diff tool)

To compare English keys to another locale and list missing keys, use the helper script located in `play/scripts/diff-i18n.ts`.

```bash
cd play
npm run i18n:diff -- fr-FR   # compare (fr-FR translations to en-US)
```

- Advanced: specify both target and source locales (default source is en-US):

```bash
cd play
npm run i18n:diff -- ar-SA fr-FR  # compare (ar-SA translations to fr-FR)
```

The target locale argument is required for the generic command. The output lists modules and keys missing in the target locale, helping translators keep parity with English files while preserving placeholders.
