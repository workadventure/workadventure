# Player

### Get the player name

```
WA.player.name: string;
```

The player name is available from the `WA.player.name` property.

:::info
You need to wait for the end of the initialization before accessing `WA.player.name`
:::

```typescript
WA.onInit().then(() => {
    console.log('Player name: ', WA.player.name);
})
```

### Get the player ID

```
WA.player.id: string|undefined;
```

The player ID is available from the `WA.player.id` property.
This is a unique identifier for a given player. Anonymous player might not have an id.

:::info
You need to wait for the end of the initialization before accessing `WA.player.id`
:::

```typescript
WA.onInit().then(() => {
    console.log('Player ID: ', WA.player.id);
})
```

### Get the player language

```
WA.player.language: string;
```

The current language of player is available from the `WA.player.language` property.

:::info
You need to wait for the end of the initialization before accessing `WA.player.language`
:::

```typescript
WA.onInit().then(() => {
    console.log('Player language: ', WA.player.language);
})
```

### Get the tags of the player

```
WA.player.tags: string[];
```

The player tags are available from the `WA.player.tags` property.
They represent a set of rights the player acquires after login in.

:::caution
Tags attributed to a user depend on the authentication system you are using. For the hosted version
of WorkAdventure, you can define tags related to the user in the [administration panel](/admin/members).
:::

:::info
You need to wait for the end of the initialization before accessing `WA.player.tags`
:::

```typescript
WA.onInit().then(() => {
    console.log('Tags: ', WA.player.tags);
})
```

### Get the position of the player
```
WA.player.getPosition(): Promise<Position>
```
The player's current position is available using the `WA.player.getPosition()` function.

`Position` has the following attributes :
* **x (number) :** The coordinate x of the current player's position.
* **y (number) :** The coordinate y of the current player's position.


:::info
You need to wait for the end of the initialization before calling `WA.player.getPosition()`
:::

```typescript
WA.onInit().then(async () => {
    console.log('Position: ', await WA.player.getPosition());
})
```

### Get the woka of the player
```
WA.player.getWokaPicture(): Promise<string>
```

The player's Woka picture can be fetched using the `WA.player.getWokaPicture()` function.

This will return a promise resolving to a base64 encoded PNG of the Woka.
The Woka is facing south, in "standing" position.

### Get the user-room token of the player

```
WA.player.userRoomToken: string;
```

The user-room token is available from the `WA.player.userRoomToken` property.

This token can be used by third party services to authenticate a player and prove that the player is in a given room.
The token is generated by the administration panel linked to WorkAdventure. The token is a string and is depending on your implementation of the administration panel.
In WorkAdventure SAAS version, the token is a JWT token that contains information such as the player's room ID and its associated membership ID.

If you are using the self-hosted version of WorkAdventure and you developed your own administration panel, the token can be anything.
By default, self-hosted versions of WorkAdventure don't come with an administration panel, so the token string will be empty.

:::info
A typical use-case for the user-room token is providing logo upload capabilities in a map.
The token can be used as a way to authenticate a WorkAdventure player and ensure he is indeed in the map and authorized to upload a logo.
:::

:::info
You need to wait for the end of the initialization before accessing `WA.player.userRoomToken`
:::

```typescript
WA.onInit().then(() => {
    console.log('Token: ', WA.player.userRoomToken);
})
```

### Get the position of the player
```
WA.player.getPosition(): Promise<Position>
```
The player's current position is available using the `WA.player.getPosition()` function.

`Position` has the following attributes :
* **x (number) :** The coordinate x of the current player's position.
* **y (number) :** The coordinate y of the current player's position.


:::info
You need to wait for the end of the initialization before calling `WA.player.getPosition()`
:::

```typescript
WA.onInit().then(async () => {
    console.log('Position: ', await WA.player.getPosition());
})
```


### Listen to player movement
```
WA.player.onPlayerMove(callback: HasPlayerMovedEventCallback): void;
```
Listens to the movement of the current user and calls the callback. Sends an event when the user stops moving, changes direction and every 200ms when moving in the same direction.

The event has the following attributes :
*   **moving (boolean):**  **true** when the current player is moving, **false** otherwise.
*   **direction (string):** **"right"** | **"left"** | **"down"** | **"top"** the direction where the current player is moving.
*   **x (number):** coordinate X of the current player.
*   **y (number):** coordinate Y of the current player.
*   **oldX (number):** old coordinate X of the current player.
*   **oldY (number):** old coordinate Y of the current player.

**callback:** the function that will be called when the current player is moving. It contains the event.

Example :
```javascript
WA.player.onPlayerMove(console.log);
```

## Player specific variables

Similarly to maps (see [API state related functions](api-state.md)), it is possible to store data **related to a specific player** in a "state". Such data will be stored using the local storage from the user's browser. Any value that is serializable to JSON can be stored.

Each variable can be stored and fetched in a variety of ways.

Here is what defines a player variable.

**Visibility:**

A player variable can be **public** or **private**.
- Public variables are automatically shared to players around you. Players around you can view
these variables using the `RemotePlayer.state` object (you can get a `RemotePlayer` object) using
[`WA.players.list()`](api-players.md).
- Private variables are only accessible by the current user.

**Persistence:**

A player variable can be **persisted** or **transient**

- Persisted variables are stored across sessions. If you refresh your page or come back later,
  a persisted variable can be fetched again. Use "persisted variables" to store valuable values
  (like a score in a game that is played in the long run)
- Transient variables disappear as soon as the connection to the room is lost. So if you
  you refresh your page, if your network connection is lost for a brief amount of time, or
  if you simply close WorkAdventure and come back later, the transient player variable value
  will be lost. Use transient variables for values that are short-lived in inherently tied to
  the game state. For instance, if you are doing a live voting system, you can use a transient
  variable to store the current vote of the player.

**Time to live:**

Persisted variables can have a **Time to live** (TTL):

The TTL (expressed in seconds) is the time after which the stored value will be destroyed.
TTL can be set on persisted variables only. It cannot be set on transient variables.

:::info
Depending on the server you are using, the server might itself decide of a maximum TTL for
player variables. So far, WorkAdventure SAAS version has no maximum TTL set. However, please note you should
probably not use player variables for sensitive / important information.
:::

**Scope:**

A player variable can have 2 scopes:

- **Room** scope: the player variable is attached to a given room.
- **World** scope: the player variable is set for a given world. It is shared with all the rooms
  of this world.

:::info About the notion of "world":

If you are using the SAAS version (online version) of WorkAdventure, you can create your worlds from the admin dashboard
and put your rooms in those worlds.

If you are using the self-hosted version of WorkAdventure (with no custom admin API configured), there is only one world, 
and it is shared by all the rooms defined in the map-storage (i.e. by all URLs starting with `/~/`).

In both cases, any URL starting with `/_/` is **not part** of any world. Trying to set a player variable with a scope
"world" for URLs starting with `/_/` will be the same as setting the scope to "room".
:::




:::info
Player variables can be stored in 2 different places. If the player is logged, the player variables are stored on
the WorkAdventure server. If the player is not logged, the player variables are stored in local storage (so in the
player's browser).
:::


### Setting a player variable
A player variable can be set simply by assigning a value.

Example:
```javascript
WA.player.state.foo = "value"
```

By **default**, variables saved are **persisted** and **private** in the **world** scope.

If you want to set some options, you will need to use the `saveVariable` function:

```typescript
WA.player.state.saveVariable(
    key: string,
    value: unknown,
    options?: {
        public?: boolean;
        persist?: boolean;
        ttl?: number;
        scope?: "world" | "room";
    }
): Promise<void>;
```

For instance, setting a variable shared with other players, that is accessible from any rooms of the current world
with a time to live of one day:

```javascript
WA.player.state.saveVariable("foo", "value", {
  public: true,
  persist: true,
  ttl: 24 * 3600,
  scope: "world",
});
```

### Reading a player variable
A player variable can be read by calling its key from the player's state.

Example:
```javascript
WA.player.state.foo //will retrieve the variable
```

### Listening to a player variable change

You can listen to modifications
of any player variable by using the `WA.player.state.onVariableChange()` method.

```
WA.player.state.onVariableChange(name: string): Observable<unknown>
```

Usage:

```javascript
WA.player.state.onVariableChange('config').subscribe((value) => {
    console.log('Variable "config" changed. New value: ', value);
});
```

The `WA.plaeyr.state.onVariableChange` method returns an [RxJS `Observable` object](https://rxjs.dev/guide/observable). This is
an object on which you can add subscriptions using the `subscribe` method.

### Stopping tracking player variables

If you want to stop tracking a player variable change, the `subscribe` method returns a subscription object with an `unsubscribe` method.

**Example with unsubscription:**

```javascript
const subscription = WA.player.state.onVariableChange('config').subscribe((value) => {
    console.log('Variable "config" changed. New value: ', value);
});
// Later:
subscription.unsubscribe();
```

### Special rules for users connected several times

You can be connected several times with the same user to WorkAdventure (and WorkAdventure
will not complain about it, this is by design).
Open another tab, connect again to WorkAdventure and you will be connected to WorkAdventure
twice with the same user. We will call those users connected several times to WorkAdventure
**brothers**.

Brothers happen to share the same player variables.

Also, if one browser sets a variable to a new value, other brothers can listen to variable
changes using `WA.player.state.onVariableChange`. They will receive the new value
if they are in the same room. So far, there is a limitation preventing brothers from listening to variable changes if
they are in different rooms in the same world.





## Move player to position
```typescript
WA.player.moveTo(x: number, y: number, speed?: number): Promise<{ x: number, y: number, cancelled: boolean }>;
```
Player will try to find shortest path to the destination point and proceed to move there.
```typescript
// Let's move player to x: 250 y: 250 with speed of 10
WA.player.moveTo(250, 250, 10);
```
You can also chain movement like this:
```typescript
// Player will move to the next point after reaching first one
await WA.player.moveTo(250, 250, 10);
await WA.player.moveTo(500, 0, 10);
```
Or like this:
```typescript
// Player will move to the next point after reaching first one or stop if the movement was cancelled
WA.player.moveTo(250, 250, 10).then((result) => {
    if (!result.cancelled) {
        WA.player.moveTo(500, 0, 10);
    }
});
```
It is possible to get the information about current player's position on stop and if the movement was interrupted
```typescript
// Result will store x and y of Player at the moment of movement's end and information if the movement was interrupted
const result = await WA.player.moveTo(250, 250, 10);
// result: { x: number, y: number, cancelled: boolean }
```

## Teleport player to position

```typescript
WA.player.teleport(x: number, y: number): Promise<void>;
```

Player will be teleported to the destination point.

```typescript
// Let's teleport player to x: 250 y: 250
WA.player.teleport(250, 250);
```

:::info
You can also teleport a player to a specific entry point of the current map using the `WA.nav.goToRoom` function:
:::

```typescript
// Let's teleport the player to the entry named "my-entry-point"
WA.nav.goToRoom("#my-entry-point");
```

## Set the outline color of the player
```
WA.player.setOutlineColor(red: number, green: number, blue: number): Promise<void>;
WA.player.removeOutlineColor(): Promise<void>;
```

You can display a thin line around your player's name (the "outline").

Use `setOutlineColor` to set the outline and `removeOutlineColor` to remove it.

Colors are expressed in RGB. Each parameter is an integer between 0 and 255.

```typescript
// Let's add a red outline to our player
WA.player.setOutlineColor(255, 0, 0);
```

When you set the outline on your player, other players will see the outline too (the outline color is shared across
browsers automatically).

## Detecting when the user enters/leaves a meeting

```ts
WA.player.proximityMeeting.onJoin(): Subscription
WA.player.proximityMeeting.onLeave(): Subscription
```

The event is triggered when the user enters or leaves a proximity meeting.

Example:

```ts
WA.player.proximityMeeting.onJoin().subscribe(async (players: RemotePlayerInterface[]) => {
    WA.chat.sendChatMessage("You joined a proximity chat", "System");
});

WA.player.proximityMeeting.onLeave().subscribe(async () => {
    WA.chat.sendChatMessage("You left the proximity chat", "System");
});
```

## Detecting when a participant enters/leaves the current meeting

```ts
WA.player.proximityMeeting.onParticipantJoin(): Subscription
WA.player.proximityMeeting.onParticipantLeave(): Subscription
```

The event is triggered when a user enters or leaves a proximity meeting.

Example:

```ts
WA.player.proximityMeeting.onParticipantJoin().subscribe(async (player: RemotePlayerInterface) => {
    WA.chat.sendChatMessage("A participant joined the proximity chat", "System");
});

WA.player.proximityMeeting.onParticipantLeave().subscribe(async (player: RemotePlayerInterface) => {
    WA.chat.sendChatMessage("A participant left the proximity chat", "System");
});
```

## Playing a sound to players in the same meeting

:::warning
This feature is experimental. The signature of the function might change in the future.
:::

```ts
WA.player.proximityMeeting.playSound(url: string): Promise<void>
```

The `playSound` function plays a sound to all the players in the same bubble.
The sound will appear to come from the microphone of the player who called the function.

Example:

```ts
await WA.player.proximityMeeting.playSound("https://example.com/my_sound.mp3");
```

The method returns a promise that resolves when the sound has been played.
